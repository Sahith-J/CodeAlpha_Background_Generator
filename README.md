# Random Background Generator

This is a simple web application that generates random background gradients and applies various effects such as patterns, glitter, and marble effect. It allows you to create unique and visually appealing backgrounds for your webpages.

## How it Works

The Random Background Generator uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to dynamically generate and update the background of the webpage. Upon clicking the "Generate Background" button, a random gradient is created using two random colors. The gradient is then applied to the background of the webpage, including the area outside the button. Additionally, effects such as pattern overlay, glitter, and marble effect are added to enhance the visual appeal of the background.

The generated colors are displayed in RGB format below the button, allowing you to easily reference and use them in your projects.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Click the "Generate Background" button to generate a random background gradient with effects.
4. The generated colors will be displayed in RGB format below the button.
5. Customize the code, styles, and effects to suit your preferences and integrate them into your projects.

## Customization

You can customize the Random Background Generator according to your needs:

- Modify the CSS styles in the `styles.css` file to change the appearance of the webpage and the effects.
- Replace the `pattern.png`, `glitter.png`, and `marble.png` files with your own custom patterns, glitter images, or marble textures.
- Update the JavaScript code in the `script.js` file to add additional functionality or modify the randomization logic.

Feel free to experiment, explore, and make it truly unique!
